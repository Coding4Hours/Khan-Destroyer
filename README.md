```
(function(){ let html=document.documentElement.outerHTML; const scripts=`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ilytobias/Khan-Destroyer@main/cheats/main.js" defer></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ilytobias/Khan-Destroyer@main/cheats/build.js" defer></script>`; html=html.replace('</body>',scripts+'</body>'); console.clear(); document.open(); document.write(html); document.close(); window._menuInitAfterProgress=false; })();
```

Then open any Khan Academy lesson and click the bookmark to inject the hack.

## Safe?

Yes. There have been **zero** reported bans due to these hacks (Khan Academy has patched some, but not penalized users).  
This project is **100% open source** so you can audit the code anytime.
